summary:
abstract: "Programmable network architectures, a set of network devices that can be programmed using a domain-specific language, allowed programmers to easily customize the network devices within the data center. Thus, they have brought huge opportunities to improve existing networking features and also allow many new possible use cases for data center networks.

My work involves studying various types of new programmable network hardware, finding the unique characteristics of each type of hardware and providing software that allow programmers to easily interact with the hardware and easily deploy new type of applications on the hardware at a large scale with large performance gains. In this talk, I will present two works FBOSS and λ-NIC. FBOSS is a scalable switch software that is proven to be efficient and to scale well in a production data center
network.  λ-NIC presents a software that allows programmers to easily run and deploy generic serverless functions on programmable network interface cards (SmartNICs) with highly reduced latency and resource usage."
